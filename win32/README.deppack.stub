This is the FoFiX Win32 Dependency Pack, an archive of precompiled
libraries used by FoFiX extension modules on Windows. It should be
unpacked such that the top-level "deps" directory is a subdirectory of
the FoFiX source tree's "win32" directory.

It is built using the makedeps-cross.sh script in the FoFiX "win32"
directory. Some packages have small patches applied to them; these
patches are in the "win32" directory as well.
